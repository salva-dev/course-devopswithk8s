Each exercise content (files) is in its corresponding folder. The name of each exercise's folder starts with the exercise's number. If there is a README.md, it contains some explanation.

In the exercises with submitted file consisting of commands and outputs (named commands-and-output.txt), I've followed the following nomenclature:
```
# Comments 
$ commands
(nothing) output of the commands
```
Notes: 
- Before run commands be sure you are in the folder of exercise with cd <x.xx>
- Tested in bash
